# Earthquake Prediction

This project is based on Big data and machine learning. I have used big data technology to predict the future of the earthquake. Prediction is based on the data of the past few years.

### Technology like:
1. Pyspark --> for etl(extract, transform, load)
2. Spark MLlib --> for machine learning
3. Tableau --> for reporting, visualization and dashboard
4. Mongodb --> for storing the data
